## Technologies & Frameworks

## Notes
- **NFC** Gained familiarity in NFC technology and its application in mobile devices. Created a NFC tag writer which generates and assigns a serial number to a new NFC tag when scanned. 

- **Passenger and Python WSGI** I deployed the web app using Phusion Passenger to a Dreamhost server the organizer had set up for each team. 

- **Working with real life clients**: Working with Mini City gave me a glimpse of what it is like to work with real-life clients. Figuring out their needs and turning them into feasible technological concepts and developmental process was challenging, but nonetheless enjoyable. This experience has expanded my understanding of web development beyond mere technical aspects. It was an invaluable practice to address clientsâ€™ business needs and to come up with a feasible solution both from the technical and business perspectives.

# Mini City

Mini City is a NFC tag based data management portal (MVP) I built at Goodie Nation Hackathon. 1st Place in General category. <i>Work in progress: rebuilding on the MVP as the final project at DigitalCrafts</i>


##Technologies & Frameworks 
- HTML
- CSS/SASS
  - Compass
- Bootstrap
- Jinja2
- Python
  - Flask
- MySQL
  - Sequel Pro

##What I Learned
- **NFC** I learned what Near Field Communication is and how Android makes use of the technology. The first step was to make a simple mobile (a NFC tag writer), which will generate a serial number and assign it to a new NFC tag scanned. 

- **Passenger and Python WSGI** I deployed the web app using Phusion Passenger to a Dreamhost server the organizer had set up for each team. 

##Problems Solved
- **Working with real life clients**: Working with Mini City was vastly different from working on an in-class or a personal project. It gave me a glimpse of what it is like to work with real-life clients. The original idea was vague and broad, without technological consideration. Figuring out their needs and turning them into technical concepts and developmental process was challenging but enjoyable. My view on web development has been broadened to see non-technological side of it. Undestanding buisness logic is another important key to successful web development.
